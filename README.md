# Design Patterns with Go

Here we explore all possible design patterns that would work with Golang.
And see if this even makes sense at all 👨‍🔬

Here's what we plan to go through, and we've achieved so far:

- SOLID
    - [x] Single Responsibility Principle (**SRP**)
    - [x] Open-Closed Principle (**OCP**)
    - [x] Liskov Substitution Principle (**LSP**)
    - [x] Interface Segregation Principle (**ISP**)
    - [x] Dependency Inversion Principle (**DIP**)

> Useful principles of not so useful object-oriented design

- Builder
    - [x] Builder
    - [x] Builder Facets
    - [x] Builder Parameter
    - [x] Functional Builder

> When constructing gets a little bit to complicated
